    "**[20 points] Linear regression and nonlinear transformations**. You're given training and testing data contained in files \"A2_Q7_train.csv\" and \"A2_Q7_test.csv\" in the \"data\" folder for this assignment. Your goal is to develop a regression algorithm from the training data that performs well on the test data.\n",

    "**(a)** Create a scatter plot of your training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**(b)** Estimate a linear regression model ($y = a_0 + a_1 x$) for the training data and calculate both the $R^2$ value and mean square error for the fit of that model for the training data. Also provide the equation representing the estimated model (e.g. $y = a_0 + a_1 x$, but with the estimated coefficients inserted. Consider this your baseline model against which you will compare other model options.\n",
    "\n",
    "**(c)** If features can be nonlinearly transformed, a linear model may incorporate those non-linear feature transformation relationships in the training process. From looking at the scatter plot of the training data, choose a transformation of the predictor variable, $x$ that may make sense for these data. This will be a multiple regression model of the form $y = a_0 + a_1 x_1 + a_2 x_2 + \\ldots + a_n x_n$. Here $x_i$ could be any transformations of x - perhaps it's $\\frac{1}{x}$, $log(x)$, $sin(x)$, $x^k$ (where $k$ is any power of your choosing). Provide the estimated equation for this multiple regression model (e.g. if you chose your predictors to be $x_1 = x$ and $x_2 = log(x)$, your model would be of the form $y = a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 log(x)$. Also provide the $R^2$ and mean square error of the fit for the training data.\n",

    "**(f)** Which models perform better on the training data, and which on the test data? Why?\n",
    "\n",
